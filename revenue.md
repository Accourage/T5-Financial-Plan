# Revenue Stream

Accourage will generate revenue through transaction fees and sponsered jobs. Accourage plans to have a high volume of transactions, resulting in a small fee taken from each one. One fee will support infrastructure, while another fee will support labor costs and the house fee. Sponsered jobs will cost the provider a pretty large fee in exchange for premium placement and advertisment. Business partners will drive customers to use the serveice, and will be given reduced fees in exchange for mutual advertisment.
