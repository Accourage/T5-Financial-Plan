# 3 Year Financial Plan

During the first three years of our business, a lot of our finances will go towards the servers running our company.
We will be using cloud servers, so we will need to pay for those. In the first year, we will be spending a lot of money on promoting the busienss.
In order to start making a profit, we need users on the app.
We plan on promoting on social media apps because the audience who use those apps are more likely to adapt to new technology based service.
During the second year, we will begin spending money on brand deals.
We hope that once our business gains recognition, large brands will want to work with us to promote their products for our service.
These brands could be restaurants, retailers, or trade companies.
In the third year of our business operating, we will start to invest finances into reshpaing our service.
We will take feedback from the (hopefully) many users to make our app beter for all of our users.
